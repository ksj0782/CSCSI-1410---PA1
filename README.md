# CSCSI-1410---PA1
# This is a project from a freshman class where I learned basic of C++.

Menu 1 - Does some mathematical steps for every number from 0 to 99. endl
        a) If the number (first) is less than 10, multiply it by 10.
        b) Break the two digit number into a tens digit and a ones digit
        c) (Remember that an integer / integer results in an truncated integer, not rounded up or down)
        d) For example 26/10 = 2 (tens), 2*10 = 20, 26-20 = 6 (ones)
        e) Reverse the digits (second) (Again think of this as reversing the tens digit with the ones digit).
        f) Subtract the second number from the first (third)
        g) If the result (third) is negative, multiple by -1.
        h) If the result (third) is less than 10, multiple it by 10.
        i) Take the result (third), reverse the digits (fourth)
        j) Add (third) to (fourth).
        
        If the answer is 99 print out a congratulations message. 
        If not, print a message that you may have done something wrong.
        
       
Menu 2 -  a) Use print (cout) statements to show every mathematical step.
          b) Ask somebody to pick a number.
          c) Double that number (B).
          d) Add 9 to the result. (C)
          e) Subtract 3 from that result (D).
          f) Divide that result (E) by 2.
          g) And finally, subtract the original number.
          h) If the answer is 3 print out a congratulations message. 
             If not, print a message that you may have done something wrong
             
            
Menu 3 - Gives an ending message and exit out of the program


Menu 4 - Does the same thing as item 2, but reads information in from a file instead of from the console.
